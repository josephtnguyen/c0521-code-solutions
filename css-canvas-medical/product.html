          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
          staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more productive, less
          stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

            Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your notes, so you never have to leave it.
            And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

            That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions.
